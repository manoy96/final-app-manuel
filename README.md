1. Effectively use conditional logic and JavaScript array methods to render large lists.

  This was achieved on my Home page by using a loop and calling data from an API. 
  [Here](https://github.com/manoy96/final-app-manuel/blob/master/src/views/Home.vue).

2. Encapsulate your code as VueJS single-file components.

  I have components for my Header, Footer, and 2 learning components. 
  [Components](https://github.com/manoy96/final-app-manuel/tree/master/src/components).

3. Work with the Vue-CLI to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.

  as of 12/10/18 my VUE Cli is at 3.1.1

4. Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of at least 4 days of commits each week from October 15th through December 6th.

See [My Commits Here](https://github.com/manoy96).

5. Allow communication between components using props, custom events, or local store.

  I created 2 comonents to help users learn a little bit about Amiibos. Users can select through different facts that will display. Props
  [Learn](https://github.com/manoy96).
  [Learn Details](https://github.com/manoy96).

6. Present a form for user input that provides useful form validation and feedback.
7. Create a custom directive and use it on at least one of your components.
8. Use a mix of animations and transitions to enhance some aspects of your project.
9. Connect to a server using HTTP and display retrieved data (use vue-resource or Axios).
10. Provide at least 3 different routes with navigation between them using vue-router.
11. Manage your application's state using vuex.
12. Structure, document, and deploy your final project code according to common industry practices.
